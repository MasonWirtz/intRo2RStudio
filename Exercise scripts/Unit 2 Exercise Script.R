# Exercise 1          #
#######################

# Create an object (i.e. variable, container) called
# `testObject` and store five numbers in it.









#######################
# Exercise 2          #
#######################

# Create a **character** vector of your
# name and save it as the object `Name`

# **HINT**
# The individual elements of a
# character vector must be under quotation marks









#######################
# Exercise 3          #
#######################

# Create a vector named `numbers` and save
# the sequence 1--100 in it.









#######################
# Exercise 4          #
#######################

# In R, we have arithmetic operators (we will go
# into logical operators later) with which we can do
# simple math. Below, you can find a list of these,
# which are all very self-explanatory.

#  |   Operator        |   Description            |
#  |-------------------|--------------------------|
#  |   +               |   Addition               |
#  |   -               |   Subtraction            |
#  |   *               |   Multiplication         |
#  |   /               |   Division               |
#  |   ^ OR **         |   Exponentiation         |

# Add 1 and 1 together to get two







#######################
# Exercise 5          #
#######################

# We can also add vectors together, provided they
# are numeric. Add the two vectors below together.
# Why does R throw an error?

a = 4:9
b = 10:17

# What would we need to do in order to fix this error?








#######################
# Exercise 6          #
#######################

# Create two vectors (using whatever numerical values
# you'd like) under the names `a` and `b` (the two variables
# above will be overwritten) and divide the two vectors.








#######################
# Exercise 7          #
#######################

# Alright, let's say we ran an experiment and
# tested the reaction times of a language learner
# once a day for seven days. We have the reaction
# times (these are provided for you, see below),
# but we want to make a vector with the days of the week.

# Create a character vector with the days of the week
# and save it as `daysOfTheWeek`

reactionTimes = rnorm(n = 7, mean = .25, sd = .1)    # you don't need to do anything here

daysOfTheWeek =                                      # complete the exercise here
